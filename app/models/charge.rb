# Conceptually, a charge can be related to: a product ordered (order_id and product_id set); a box in storage (associated with a storage_charge); 
# a shipment (shipping_id set); an order's shipping costs (only order id set); or nothing at all (in which case created_by_admin_id should be set). 
# The reason for this is workflow. You pay for shipping once per order,
# not once for each line, even though shipments (in this case, of returns) get processed potentially individually, so in that case the order id for
# the charge is set, not the shipping id. Shipping charges that are explicitly charged for an individual shipment occur when a user does not commit
# enough for free shipping, but we don't know the shipping cost yet because we haven't actually shipped it (and can't charge them beforehand because
# we don't know the package weight) so we can't charge them for the order's shipping cost, then later when the shipment is processed we record that
# in the system, at which point the shipment gets "charged" and that charge has a shipment id.

# Also, note that charges are not associated with payments at this time. The user's balance is the sum of all charges and payments. This addresses the
# fact that payments may be made well after charges, and may be for multiple charges, and charges may span payments. Not worth tracking.

# In retrospect, this is a bit confusing -- potential to refactor so that charges can be associated with order lines instead of orders, to tie them
# better with actual shipments made later. -DZ 20110922
