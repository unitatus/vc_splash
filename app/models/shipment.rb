# Note: at this time there is no need for a shipment line, because we don't have the need to track shipment line items.
# If a shipment is associated with a box that means that the shipment is for the box.
# If a shipment is associated with an order line that means it shipped one or more empty boxes. We only have the capability to ship
# entire order lines at this time.
