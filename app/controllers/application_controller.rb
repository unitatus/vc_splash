  # This is a bit of a hack -- the warden code below is taken from devise -- but it is the only way I could come up with to

  # process by devise (which means that if we decorated that method it would either break the console (because devise does 
  # not load there first) or it would not work the first time you hit the code in production). -DZ
  #
  # Note: we are not using switch_user (a gem for switching users) or having devise log out - log in because to do so 
  # causes cookie problems in production.

  # Note also: this method must live in application controller for the hack to work (not in the helper)
