	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br><Br>
	
	<p class="q">Q: What does "inventorying" mean?</p>
	<p>A: Inventorying is an optional service provided by The Visible Closet. If you choose to inventory, we will open your box, take pictures of the items inside, "tag" each picture with a series of text descriptions, and post the pictures to your account so you can easily see what you have in storage, search for items, and manage items individually.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: What does "tagging" mean?</p>
	<p>A: Tagging is that act of associating certain words with the items you have in storage. For instance, if you put a pair of white sneakers in storage, we might tag them with the words "sneaker", "white", and "shoe". You could then enter "shoe" in the site search and find them. Note that you can add to or remove tags for your items as well.</p>
	
	<p class="q">Q: Can I tag my items?</p>
	<p>A: Certainly! Just go into the "details" menu for an item by mousing over its picture to enter or remove tags.</p>
	
	<p class="q">Q: Do I have to choose the inventory option?</p>
	<p>A: Absolutely not! We only inventory the boxes that you have chosen to be inventoried. Any boxes not marked for inventorying are never opened by us.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: What does "manage items individually" mean?</p>
	<p>A: The services we plan to offer include selling items, shipping items to an address of your choosing, donating items to charity, and environmentally sustainable disposal of items. All of these services are only available if you have chosen to inventory a box.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: Do you ship internationally?</p>
	<p>A: We are working on it! We plan to offer this option soon. At this time, however, we only ship within the United States.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: How do I ship my box to you?</p>
	<p>A: First, sign up to have your box stored. Once you have done so, you will have the opportunity to print out a Fedex shipping label. Print that on any printer, affix it to your box, and contact Fedex at 1-800-GO-FEDEX to schedule an appointment to have your box picked up (or visit any of Fedex's many locations to drop it off). If you have committed to a subscription, then you are done! If you have not, you will be billed later for shipping costs once we receive those from FedEx.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: Can I ship my boxes using another carrier besides FedEx?</p>
	<p>A: Sure! Just send us an email and we'll give you the details.
